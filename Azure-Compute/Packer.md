## Packer: 
 1. I need 100's Machine with same Setup Installation and Configurations.  
     1. Manual way: 
        1. Create 100 Machine and login into Each Machine and Install all setof Software and configuration 
        2. Taking too much time, More chances happen human errors.  
     2. Automated way: 
        1. Create 1 Machine and install all Softwares and configurations, If you done with All Setup then Create Image -- Create Image using Packer
