## IP Address 
   1. IP Internet Protocal 
   2. How to access Internernet via IP Address 
   3. Types of IP Address 
        1. Public: We can Access any where
            1. Static 
                1. this IP address Never change
            2. Dynamic 
                2. this IP address will change when you restart Machine
        2. Private Address: We can Access only within the network
            1. reserved Private Ip Ranges 
                1. 192.168.x.x/x ---> <65k you can connect upto 65k devices
                2. 172.16.x.x/x to 172.32.x.x/x ---> >65k you can connect more than 65k devices
                3. 10.x.x.x/x ---> you can connect up 4.5 crores   

### How to access Internet 
   1. we access internet only with Public IP, We can't access with private 
   2. But we still access internet with Private IP Address using ISP ie BSNL, Hathway, Act fiber, Airtel Vodafone 

### Types of IP Version 
   1. Ipv4
      1. this IP address consists of 4 bytes and 32 bits 
      2. we can connect up 2^32 devices 
      3. eg: 192.168.5.6 
      4. Computer can not understand decimal and hexadecimal 
      5. so its convert into Binary format 
      6. IPV4 means 4 bits each bit separate by dot(.), 1bit == 8 bytes, each byte represents 0 or 1
      7. what is the Maximum values of bit --> 255 convert binary 11111111 
      8. what is the minimum value of bit ---> 0 convert into binary 00000000 
      9. subnet mask --> 255.255.255.0 ~> 1111111.1111111.111111.0000000 

   2. Ipv6: 
      1. this the big range, if you want to connect more than 4.5 cr device then you need to use IPV6 
      2. 2^128
